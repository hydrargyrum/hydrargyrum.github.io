# Introducing comments

From now on, posts on this site will support comments using [Commento](https://commento.io/), an open-source commenting system.

The site remains statically generated, comments are stored on another server, with a form requiring javascript.
However, the script is [loaded with opt-in](https://github.com/dancek/opt-in-script) only.

[Sample Docker conf](https://gitlab.com/hydrargyrum/docker-samples/-/tree/master/commento) of how to host
[Commento](https://commento.io/) with front [Caddy server](https://caddyserver.com/).
