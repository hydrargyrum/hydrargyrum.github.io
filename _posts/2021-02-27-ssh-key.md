# SSH tips

# Client

## Show fingerprints of current host

	for pub in /etc/ssh/*.pub; do ssh-keygen -l -f $pub ; done

## Show saved fingerprint of a host

	ssh-keygen -F $host -l

## Aliases

Alias to replace

	ssh -i ~/.ssh/dedicated-key -p 1234 somebody@example.com

with simply

	ssh my-alias

Use this config:

##### File: `~/.ssh/config`

	Host my-alias
		HostName example.com
		Port 1234
		User somebody
		IdentityFile ~/.ssh/dedicated-key

This can also prove useful if you want multiple identities for the same hostname,
in situations where passing parameters to `ssh` is complicated, for example
using different keys on the same `git` host:

##### File: `~/.ssh/config`

	Host git1
		HostName git.example.com
		Port 22
		User git
		IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gitkey1

	Host git2
		HostName git.example.com
		Port 22
		User git
		IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gitkey2

And then a git URL can be set like this:

	git remote set-url origin ssh://git1/repo.git

## Splitting `~/.ssh/config`

If the SSH config gets too big, one can split in in multiple config files easily.

##### File: `~/.ssh/config`

	Include ~/.ssh/config.d/*.conf

Then one can create `~/.ssh/config.d/` directory and put as many `.conf` files in it as wanted.

# Server

## Restrict access to some users

##### File: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

	AllowUsers john jane

## Have key-only authentication for some users but not all

##### File: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

        Match User jane
		AuthenticationMethods publickey

## Restrict commands allowed for a user (depending on the public key used)

Instead of having the classic

##### File: `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

	ssh-rsa the-fingerprint foo@bar

use

##### File: `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

	command="the command to allow",restrict ssh-rsa the-fingerprint foo@bar

When ssh-ing with the key that fingerprint, only one command will be allowed.
This makes it possible to distribute different keys to different users, who will ssh with a single user name but can only run different commands.


## Only port-forwarding for some user

##### File: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

	Match User jane
		# allows -R <anything>:localhost:1234
		PermitListen localhost:1234
		AllowTcpForwarding remote

		# or for -L <anything>:somehost:1234
		# PermitOpen somehost:1234
		# AllowTcpForwarding local

		X11Forwarding no
		PermitTTY no
		AllowAgentForwarding no
		AllowStreamLocalForwarding no

Pay attention to the [`sshd_config(5)`](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config#AllowTcpForwarding) note on `AllowTcpForwarding` option:

> Note that disabling TCP forwarding does not improve security unless users are also denied shell access, as they can always install their own forwarders.
