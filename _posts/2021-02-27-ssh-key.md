# SSH tips

# Client

## Show fingerprints of current host

	for pub in /etc/ssh/*.pub; do ssh-keygen -l -f $pub ; done

## Show saved fingerprint of a host

	ssh-keygen -F $host -l

## Aliases

Alias to replace

	ssh -i ~/.ssh/dedicated-key -p 1234 somebody@my.complicated.host

with simply

	ssh my-alias

Use this config:

##### File: `~/.ssh/config`

	Host my-alias
		HostName my.complicated.host
		Port 1234
		User somebody
		IdentityFile ~/.ssh/dedicated-key

# Server

## Restrict access to some users

##### File: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

	AllowUsers john jane

## Have key-only authentication for some users but not all

##### File: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

        Match User jane
		AuthenticationMethods publickey

## Restrict commands allowed for a user (depending on the public key used)

Instead of having the classic

##### File: `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

	ssh-rsa the-fingerprint foo@bar

use

##### File: `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

	command="the command to allow",restrict ssh-rsa the-fingerprint foo@bar

When ssh-ing with the key that fingerprint, only one command will be allowed.
This makes it possible to distribute different keys to different users, who will ssh with a single user name but can only run different commands.


## Only port-forwarding for some user

##### File: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

	Match User jane
		AllowTcpForwarding remote
		X11Forwarding no
		PermitTTY no
		AllowAgentForwarding no
		AllowStreamLocalForwarding no
