# Announcing Python exercises

"Python exercises" is a series of exercises on mildly advanced Python exercises, like overloading operators, creating decorators and context managers.

Each exercise is a single file where you should write code in the blanks. The files contain automated tests to check your implementation is correct. The tests should be run with the `pytest the_exercise.py` command. Some of the solutions are provided.

See [Python exercises repository](https://gitlab.com/hydrargyrum/python-exercises).
