# Regular expression support in command-line tools

Many command-line tools support regular expressions, but there exists multiple regular expression syntaxes, with different features.

# Pattern types

## Basic Regular Expressions (BRE)

BRE is the most basic regular expression syntax commonly found.
It's [standardized](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap09.html) in POSIX.

In BRE, these characters have a special meaning:

	^ $ . * [ ] \

... and escaping them loses their special meaning.

On the other hand, those characters need to be escaped to gain a special meaning:

	( ) { }

... otherwise they have no special meaning.

Other characters are ordinary and shall match themselves literally.

`\1` to `\9` are used for back-references to previous capturing groups.

**Note**: BRE syntax is incompatible with most other regular expression syntaxes.

## Extended Regular Expressions (ERE)

Like BRE, ERE is a regular expression syntax commonly found and standardized in POSIX.

In ERE, these characters have a special meaning:

	^ $ . * + ? [ ] ( ) { } |

### Difference with BRE
Unlike in BRE, escaping a character can only make it lose its special meaning.
Also, EREs doesn't support back-references.

**Note**: ERE syntax is a subset of most other regular expressions syntax.

## Perl regular expressions (PCRE)

Perl regular expressions are very expressive, and are often available in common tools, not just in Perl programs, thanks to the [PCRE](https://www.pcre.org/) library.
Its syntax is described in [`perlre` manual page](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlre).

## Python regular expressions

[Python regular expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax) have similar features to PCREs though they differ a bit on advanced features.
Unlike PCREs, Python REs are only available when used through Python programs, like [fail2ban](http://www.fail2ban.org/).

### Example of common features with PCRE and same syntax

	(capturing group) (?:non-capturing group)
	lazy+? quantifiers*? non-greedy?? text{1,2}?
	\s \S \d \D \w \W \A \Z \b \B \N{CODEPOINT NAME}
	(?=lookahead) (?!negative lookahead) (?<=lookbehind) (?<!negative lookbehind)
	(?#comment)

Flags are supported:

	(?aimsux-imsx)

PCRE [introduced compatibility](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlre#PCRE/Python-Support) with some Python syntax:

	(?P<name>capturing group) (?P=name)

### Example of similar features with PCRE but different syntax

	\g<name>

## Go regular expressions (RE2)

Most Go programs use their standard lib's [regex module](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp), which uses the [RE2 engine](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax). The most notable differences with PCRE and Python regular expressions is that RE2 does not support backreferences at all, and neither lookaheads/lookbehinds.

# Tools

[POSIX `grep`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/grep.html):
- `grep` uses BRE by default
- `grep -E` (or `egrep`) uses ERE
- `grep -F` (or `fgrep`) uses fixed string (just a static string, not a regular expression)

GNU `grep`:
- same behavior as POSIX `grep`
- `grep -P` uses Perl regular expressions

POSIX `sed`:
- uses BRE (with [modifications](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sed.html#tag_20_116_13_02))

GNU `sed`:
- same behavior as POSIX `sed`
- supports ERE with `-E` flag

[`git-grep`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-grep) (and other git tools):
- `-G` (the default) uses BRE
- `-E` for ERE
- `-F` for fixed strings
- `-P` for Perl regular expressions
