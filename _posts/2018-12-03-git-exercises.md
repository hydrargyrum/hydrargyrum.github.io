# Announcing git exercises

"Git exercises" is a series of exercises on advanced git topics like git-rebase.

Each exercise consists in a git repository which should be cloned, and the exercice must be made inside that repository. Each exercice has a "STATEMENT.txt" file stating a situation to solve, a few example files on which to operate with (mostly) git commands, and a "SOLUTION.txt" explaining how to solve the problem if you can't solve the exercise.

See [Git exercises repository](https://framagit.org/git-exercises/index).
