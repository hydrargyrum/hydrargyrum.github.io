# SIT-Tagger #

SIT-Tagger is an image browser/viewer where folders full of images can be browsed, and tags be set to pictures (and saves those tags in a database file). Then, SIT-Tagger can browse all pictures that were associated to particular tags, instead of only browsing by path.

The tags are saved in a local SQLite database.

## Download ##

Tagger requires Python 3 and PyQt5.

It is licensed under the WTFPLv2.
